# Music-Recommender
This is a simple music recommending system. Given a spotify playlist, this system will recommend songs based on the perceived taste. The system has been built with K-Means algorithm. The resultant clusters has been illustrated using tSNE algorithm. Moreover, the efficacy of the K-Means algorithm was determined with Silhouette method. 

The model was trained on Spotify Dataset on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/vatsalmavani/music-recommendation-system-using-spotify-dataset/data).
